Co-branding between a fashion brand and a hotel
The client's study was about co-branding between a fashion brand and a hotel. I was presented with 2 hypothesis that they wanted to test. Client had 120 responses on a survey with 14 questions on a 5-point Likert scale. They were considering an initial psychometric analysis which included a factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, construct reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE), Spearman's correlation, and afterwards any type of hypothesis tests that would be useful for the research question's design.

I have offered consultation of appropriate testing method. Additionally, I have cleaned the data, and the participants who did not meet the requested criteria were eliminated. The variables were computed as instructed by the client. I have performed the requested psychometric analysis (Factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha using SPSS, and CR & AVE using Excel) and I have provided statistical interpretation for it. Next, I have performed 2 hypothesis testing (additional testing included assumption verification before actual testing) and statistical interpretation of results.

The Cronbachâ€™s Alpha analysis was requested to confirm prior survey validation of another study, and it was confirmed as being proper, which has shown the coefficient being okay for only two out of the three constructs.

The factor analysis revealed that the 3 factors are indeed delimited from each other, but I advised the client they might want to keep in mind that Q9 has the smallest contribution to factor 1 (I have mentioned this in the material as well), and it also appears loading for factor 3 as well, still, loading very poorly.

I have tested the 2 hypotheses, which included 1 Linear Regression and 1 Hayes Process Macro (Model 1). As the results concluded, only one of the two confirmed as being good fit for the models.

All of the tables and figures were generated, formatted, named and labeled using APA Style.
